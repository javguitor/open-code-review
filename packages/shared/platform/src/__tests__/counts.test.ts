/**
 * The counts module is the single source of truth for per-round finding-count
 * derivation, shared by the CLI writer (`computeRoundCounts`, the
 * `synthesis_counts` cross-check) and the dashboard reader (`filesystem-sync`).
 * These tests pin the canonical rule — prefer the deduplicated
 * `synthesis_counts` when present, else derive per-category from
 * `findings[].category` — and the `style`-omission, and prove that the two
 * historical call sites can no longer drift (they call THIS function).
