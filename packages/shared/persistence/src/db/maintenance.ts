/**
 * Database maintenance — the operator-facing hygiene primitives behind
 * `ocr db doctor / prune / vacuum`.
 *
 * These are the PRODUCTIZED form of the one-time live-incident remediation that
 * shrank a corrupted 298 MB database to 8.5 MB: an FK-orphan sweep (84,611
 * violations → 0), markdown-artifact dedup (17,484 rows → 406), orphan-temp
 * reaping (~1 GB), and VACUUM. The migration runner heals a database silently
 * on upgrade (migration v14); this module makes the same hygiene a first-class,
 * on-demand, snapshot-guarded operator tool that also reports health.
 *
 * Invariants honored EVERYWHERE here:
 *  - `orchestration_events` and `sessions` are the immutable system of record.
 *    No operation deletes a row from them — the FK-orphan sweep PROTECTS them
 *    (a violation against a protected table is reported, never auto-deleted),
 *    and prune removes only the cascade *artifact* subtree, never events or the
 *    session row.
 *  - Every mutating entry point snapshots the DB file first (best-effort) so a
 *    bad sweep is always reversible.
 *  - `PRAGMA foreign_keys` is toggled only in autocommit (never inside a
 *    transaction, where SQLite silently ignores it).
