/**
 * Agent-session journal helpers.
 *
 * Backed by the `command_executions` table — every spawned CLI subprocess
 * gets exactly one row, whether it was started by the dashboard's command
 * runner or by the AI calling `ocr session start-instance`. The "agent
 * session" concept is a logical view over `command_executions` rows whose
 * `last_heartbeat_at` is non-null (i.e., they participate in the journaled
 * lifecycle, as opposed to fire-and-forget utility commands).
 *
 * Status mapping (derived, no separate column):
 *   running    →  finished_at IS NULL AND last_heartbeat_at fresh
 *   stalled    →  finished_at IS NULL AND last_heartbeat_at stale (advisory
 *                 only — a stale heartbeat is NOT evidence of death; the
 *                 process may be alive and simply not beating)
 *   orphaned   →  finished_at IS NOT NULL AND exit_code = -3 — written only
 *                 when the supervised pid is confirmed dead (see
 *                 sweepStaleAgentSessions), never from heartbeat age alone
 *   done       →  exit_code = 0
 *   crashed    →  exit_code IS NOT NULL AND exit_code NOT IN (0, -2, -3, -4)
 *   cancelled  →  exit_code = -2 (user cancel) OR -4 (cascade-close: the
 *                 parent workflow closed)

 *   - status is still 'active'
 *   - no orchestration_event has been recorded for it within
 *     `thresholdSeconds` (default 7 days at call sites)
 *   - no dependent command_executions are still in flight
 *     (every linked row has finished_at NOT NULL)
 *
 * Stale rows are flipped to 'closed' with a `session_auto_closed_stale`
 * event recording the threshold and the last-event-age. This stops them
 * from poisoning latest-active auto-detect — the exact failure mode that
 * caused the "wrong session closed" bug.
 *
 * Returns the closed session_ids.
