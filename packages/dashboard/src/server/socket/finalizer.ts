/**
 * Execution finalization — the single in-process owner of "this run is done".
 *
 * Extracted from command-runner.ts (round-1 S28; the named first-wins claim is
 * round-1 S23; the ownership-boundary contract below is round-2 S2).
 *
 * ── Sweep / finalize ownership boundary (round-2 S2) ──
 * Two independent actors can mark a `command_executions` row finished:
 *
 *   1. THIS module (`finishExecution`) — owns every execution the dashboard
 *      spawned and still tracks in the in-memory `activeCommands` registry. It
 *      is triggered by the vendor `result` event, `proc.on('close')`, the
 *      watchdog, or cancel. Among those same-process triggers, the in-memory
 *      `tryClaimFinalization` claim guarantees exactly one runs the body.
 *
 *   2. The cross-process LIVENESS SWEEP (CLI `reconcileCompletedSessions` /
 *      the agent-session orphan stamp) — owns rows whose OWNING PROCESS IS
 *      GONE (dashboard crashed/restarted), which this module can no longer see
 *      because its `activeCommands` entry died with the process.
 *
 * The two never both own the same live row: while a row's owner is alive it is
 * in `activeCommands` and the sweep leaves it alone; once the owner is gone the
 * sweep takes over. The shared backstop that makes the boundary safe even
 * during the handoff window is the DB CAS — every finalizing UPDATE is gated on
 * `finished_at IS NULL`, so whichever actor writes first wins and the other's
 * write is a 0-row no-op. The in-memory claim de-dupes same-process triggers;
 * the DB CAS de-dupes across processes.

 * watchdog, or cancel. This is the explicit, testable claim that lets exactly
 * one of them run the finalize body: the first caller for a given entry returns
 * `true` (and the entry's watchdog timer + file tailer are released here so they
 * cannot fire after the claim); every later caller returns `false`.
 *
 * A `undefined` entry (no in-memory record — e.g. a late close on a stale
 * execution the registry already dropped) returns `true`: there is no
 * same-process trigger left to de-dupe against, so the caller proceeds to the
