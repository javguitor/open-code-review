/**
 * Per-execution supervisor watchdog: timing constants, the pure tick decision,
 * and the liveness-heartbeat writer.
 *
 * Extracted from command-runner.ts (round-1 S28; heartbeat ownership is
 * round-1 S19). The watchdog finalizes a wedged review whose work is done but
 * whose `close` is withheld (the leaked-grandchild-holds-the-pipe failure), and
 * bounds the "hung with no result" case. The imperative `setInterval` wiring
 * stays in the orchestrator (it needs the run's `emitStreamEvent` closure); this
 * module owns the reusable, independently-testable pieces:
 *   - the timing constants,
 *   - `decideWatchdogTick` (pure — every finalize/beat/wait rule lives here),
 *   - `makeHeartbeatBumper` (the throttled `last_heartbeat_at` writer, S19).

 * the watchdog reap a live review ~30s later, mid-workflow, recording exit 0.

 * only counts silence since the LAST `result`. A truly finished process emits
 * nothing after its final `result`, so the wedged-`close` finalize is unchanged.
