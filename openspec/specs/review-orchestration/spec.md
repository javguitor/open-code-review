# review-orchestration Specification

## Purpose
Review orchestration defines the 8-phase multi-agent code review workflow — from context discovery through reviewer spawning, discourse, and synthesis — that produces a prioritized, confidence-weighted final review.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Tech Lead Orchestration

The system SHALL provide a Tech Lead agent that orchestrates the complete code review process, coordinating context discovery, requirements analysis, reviewer assignment, discourse facilitation, and final synthesis.

#### Scenario: Complete review orchestration
- **GIVEN** user requests a code review
- **WHEN** the Tech Lead receives the request
- **THEN** Tech Lead SHALL execute the 8-phase workflow:
  1. Context Discovery (including requirements/specs)
  2. Gather Change Context
  3. Tech Lead Analysis
  4. Spawn Reviewers (with Redundancy)
  5. Aggregate Redundant Findings
  6. Discourse (unless --quick)
  7. Synthesis
  8. Present

#### Scenario: Tech Lead analysis
- **GIVEN** change context and requirements have been gathered
- **WHEN** Tech Lead analyzes the change
- **THEN** Tech Lead SHALL:
  - Review requirements/specs to understand intended behavior
  - Summarize what changed and why
  - Evaluate changes against requirements
  - Identify risks and areas of concern
  - Select appropriate reviewers
  - Create dynamic guidance per reviewer including requirements context

---

### Requirement: Requirements Context Input

The system SHALL accept requirements context flexibly, leveraging the AI agent's ability to discover and interpret requirements from any source the user provides.

#### Scenario: Flexible requirements input
- **GIVEN** user wants to provide requirements context
- **WHEN** user provides context via ANY of:
  - Inline description in the review request
  - Reference to a document path (spec, proposal, ticket, etc.)
  - Pasted text (bug report, acceptance criteria, notes)
- **THEN** the Tech Lead SHALL:
  - Recognize the intent to provide requirements
  - Read referenced documents if paths are provided
  - Capture and interpret the requirements
  - Propagate to all reviewer sub-agents

#### Scenario: Agent-driven requirements discovery
- **GIVEN** user mentions requirements exist somewhere
- **WHEN** the reference is ambiguous or incomplete
- **THEN** the Tech Lead MAY:
  - Search for likely spec/requirements files
  - Ask the user to clarify which document
  - Proceed with partial context and note the limitation

#### Scenario: No explicit requirements
- **GIVEN** user does not provide explicit requirements
- **WHEN** review is initiated
- **THEN** the system SHALL proceed using:
  - Discovered project standards
  - Best practices for the technology
  - Professional engineering judgment

---

### Requirement: Clarifying Questions and Scope Boundaries

The Tech Lead and all reviewer sub-agents SHALL surface clarifying questions about requirements ambiguity and scope boundaries, just as engineers do in real code reviews.

#### Scenario: Requirements ambiguity
- **GIVEN** requirements/specs contain ambiguous language
- **WHEN** the Tech Lead or a reviewer encounters the ambiguity
- **THEN** the reviewer SHALL:
  - Note the specific ambiguity
  - State their interpretation
  - Ask a clarifying question in the review output

#### Scenario: Scope boundary questions
- **GIVEN** a reviewer is uncertain whether something should be included or excluded
- **WHEN** the change appears to either:
  - Include functionality not explicitly required
  - Exclude functionality that might be expected
- **THEN** the reviewer SHALL surface a scope question:
  - "Should this include X?" or "Was X intentionally excluded?"
  - Provide reasoning for why this is worth clarifying

#### Scenario: Missing acceptance criteria
- **GIVEN** requirements lack clear acceptance criteria
- **WHEN** a reviewer cannot determine if a requirement is met
- **THEN** the reviewer SHALL:
  - State what acceptance criteria they would expect
  - Note whether the implementation appears reasonable
  - Flag for discussion with stakeholders

#### Scenario: Edge case uncertainty
- **GIVEN** requirements do not specify edge case behavior
- **WHEN** a reviewer identifies unhandled edge cases
- **THEN** the reviewer SHALL:
  - List the edge cases
  - Ask whether they should be handled
  - Suggest how they might be handled if implemented

#### Scenario: Clarifying questions in synthesis
- **GIVEN** reviewers raised clarifying questions
- **WHEN** final synthesis is generated
- **THEN** the synthesis SHALL include a "Clarifying Questions" section:
  - Questions about requirements ambiguity
  - Questions about scope boundaries
  - Questions about edge cases
  - These SHALL be surfaced prominently for stakeholder response

---

### Requirement: Natural Language Activation

The system SHALL auto-activate when the user asks to review code using natural language phrases.

#### Scenario: Natural language triggers
- **GIVEN** user sends a message
- **WHEN** message contains phrases like "review my code", "review this PR", "code review please", "check my changes", or "want feedback on my work"
- **THEN** the OCR skill SHALL activate and begin the review workflow

#### Scenario: No false activation
- **GIVEN** user discusses code review concepts without requesting one
- **WHEN** message is about code review theory or past reviews
- **THEN** the OCR skill SHALL NOT auto-activate

---

### Requirement: Explicit Command Activation

The system SHALL support explicit activation via the `/ocr:review` slash command with configurable options.

#### Scenario: Review staged changes (default)
- **GIVEN** user invokes `/ocr:review` without arguments
- **WHEN** staged changes exist in the repository
- **THEN** the system SHALL review the staged changes

#### Scenario: Review commit range
- **GIVEN** user invokes `/ocr:review HEAD~3..HEAD`
- **WHEN** the commit range is valid
- **THEN** the system SHALL review the specified commit range

#### Scenario: Review pull request
- **GIVEN** user invokes `/ocr:review pr 123`
- **WHEN** PR #123 exists and `gh` CLI is available
- **THEN** the system SHALL review the pull request diff

#### Scenario: Quick mode
- **GIVEN** user invokes `/ocr:review --quick`
- **WHEN** review workflow runs
- **THEN** the system SHALL skip the discourse phase

#### Scenario: Override redundancy
- **GIVEN** user invokes `/ocr:review --redundancy 3`
- **WHEN** review workflow runs
- **THEN** each reviewer SHALL run 3 times regardless of config

---

### Requirement: Reviewer Sub-Agent Spawning

The system SHALL spawn independent reviewer sub-agents using the Task tool, each receiving persona, project context, requirements, and Tech Lead guidance.

#### Scenario: Default reviewer team composition
- **GIVEN** user requests a review without specifying team composition
- **WHEN** Tech Lead spawns reviewers
- **THEN** the system SHALL spawn by default:
  - 2 Tasks for principal (principal-1, principal-2) - holistic architecture review
  - 2 Tasks for quality (quality-1, quality-2) - code quality review
- **AND** the system MAY optionally spawn based on change type:
  - 1 Task for security (security-1) - if auth/API/data changes detected
  - 1 Task for testing (testing-1) - if logic changes detected

#### Scenario: User-specified team composition
- **GIVEN** user specifies reviewer team in request
- **WHEN** user says "review with security focus" or "add testing reviewer" or similar
- **THEN** the Tech Lead SHALL adjust team composition accordingly

#### Scenario: Dynamic redundancy override
- **GIVEN** user specifies redundancy in request
- **WHEN** user says "use 3 principal reviewers" or "--redundancy 3" or similar
- **THEN** the system SHALL use the specified redundancy

#### Scenario: Reviewer independence
- **GIVEN** multiple reviewer Tasks are spawned
- **WHEN** each reviewer executes
- **THEN** reviewers SHALL NOT see each other's outputs during their review

#### Scenario: Reviewer context injection
- **GIVEN** a reviewer Task is spawned
- **WHEN** the reviewer begins work
- **THEN** the reviewer SHALL receive:
  - Static persona (from reviewers/*.md)
  - Discovered project context
  - Requirements/specs/proposal content (if provided)
  - Dynamic Tech Lead guidance
  - The diff and intent information

---

### Requirement: Codebase Exploration and Reviewer Agency

Each reviewer SHALL have full agency to explore the codebase as they see fit, determining what is relevant based on requirements, change goals, and their professional judgment—just as a real engineer would.

#### Scenario: Autonomous exploration
- **GIVEN** a reviewer is analyzing a code change
- **WHEN** the reviewer begins their review
- **THEN** the reviewer SHALL autonomously decide:
  - Which files to read beyond the diff
  - How deep to trace dependencies
  - What related code to examine
  - Whether to examine tests, configs, or documentation

#### Scenario: Requirements-driven exploration
- **GIVEN** requirements/specs have been provided
- **WHEN** the reviewer explores the codebase
- **THEN** the reviewer SHALL:
  - Identify code paths relevant to stated requirements
  - Trace implementation to verify requirements are met
  - Check edge cases implied by requirements
  - Examine related tests for requirements coverage

#### Scenario: Trace code relationships
- **GIVEN** a reviewer is analyzing a code change
- **WHEN** the reviewer evaluates the change
- **THEN** the reviewer MAY:
  - Read FULL files, not just diff hunks
  - Trace upstream (what calls this?)
  - Trace downstream (what does this call?)
  - Check patterns (how is similar code handled?)
  - Review related tests
  - Examine configuration and environment
  - Read documentation or comments

#### Scenario: Document exploration
- **GIVEN** a reviewer explores the codebase
- **WHEN** the reviewer documents findings
- **THEN** the review output SHALL include a "What I Explored" section listing:
  - Files examined and why
  - Code paths traced
  - How exploration informed findings

#### Scenario: Professional judgment
- **GIVEN** a reviewer has agency to explore
- **WHEN** the reviewer encounters something outside their persona's focus
- **THEN** the reviewer MAY:
  - Note it briefly for other reviewers
  - Flag it for discourse discussion
  - Pursue it if it impacts their area of expertise

---

### Requirement: Redundancy Aggregation

The system SHALL aggregate findings from redundant reviewer runs and assign confidence levels.

#### Scenario: Findings confirmed by redundancy
- **GIVEN** security reviewer ran with redundancy=2
- **WHEN** both security-1 and security-2 find the same issue
- **THEN** the finding SHALL be marked "Confirmed by redundancy" with very high confidence

#### Scenario: Single observation
- **GIVEN** security reviewer ran with redundancy=2
- **WHEN** only security-1 finds an issue (not security-2)
- **THEN** the finding SHALL be marked "Single observation" with lower confidence

---

### Requirement: Discourse Phase

The system SHALL facilitate a discourse phase where reviewers respond to each other's findings, unless `--quick` is specified.

#### Scenario: Discourse responses
- **GIVEN** all individual reviews are complete
- **WHEN** discourse phase runs
- **THEN** reviewers SHALL engage in natural discussion using:
  - AGREE: Endorse findings (increases confidence)
  - CHALLENGE: Push back with reasoning
  - CONNECT: Link findings across reviewers
  - SURFACE: Raise new concerns from discussion
- **AND** the discourse response types SHALL be fixed and not user-configurable

#### Scenario: Skip discourse
- **GIVEN** user specified `--quick` flag
- **WHEN** individual reviews complete
- **THEN** the system SHALL skip discourse and proceed to synthesis

---

### Requirement: Final Review Synthesis

The system SHALL synthesize individual reviews and discourse into a prioritized final review.

The review verdict SHALL be drawn from a closed, canonical 3-state vocabulary representing the **merge gate** only: `APPROVE` (mergeable), `REQUEST CHANGES` (blocked on required work), or `NEEDS DISCUSSION` (undecided pending a human question). Residual work — follow-ups and suggestions — SHALL NOT be expressed as verdict states; it is carried by finding **category** (`blocker / should_fix / suggestion / style`) and the derived per-round counts. The synthesizer SHALL NOT emit composite or off-vocabulary verdicts (e.g. `accept_with_followups`, `approve_with_suggestions`).

The synthesizer SHALL choose the verdict and the `blocker`-category findings **together** so they point the same direction, measured by the deduplicated blocker count (`resolveRoundCounts().blockerCount`, which honors `synthesis_counts.blockers`): it SHALL emit `REQUEST CHANGES` only when the blocker count is ≥ 1, SHALL emit `APPROVE` only when the blocker count is 0, and MAY emit `NEEDS DISCUSSION` regardless of blocker count. "Blocker" is exactly the canonical `blocker` category; `should_fix`/`suggestion`/`style` are residual work and never force `REQUEST CHANGES`. This keeps the merge gate and the findings as one consistent view, so the CLI's directional verdict ↔ blocker-count check is a backstop rather than the first line of defense.

#### Scenario: Confidence weighting
- **GIVEN** findings from multiple sources
- **WHEN** synthesis occurs
- **THEN** findings SHALL be weighted by:
  1. Redundancy consensus (found by multiple runs)
  2. Cross-reviewer consensus (found by different reviewers)
  3. Discourse confirmation
  4. Severity

#### Scenario: Deduplication
- **GIVEN** the same issue found by multiple reviewers
- **WHEN** synthesis occurs
- **THEN** the issue SHALL appear once with sources noted

#### Scenario: Final review structure
- **GIVEN** synthesis is complete
- **WHEN** final review is generated
- **THEN** it SHALL include:
  - Summary
  - Verdict (APPROVE | REQUEST CHANGES | NEEDS DISCUSSION)
  - Must Fix (Critical/High severity)
  - Should Fix (Medium severity)
  - Consider (Low/Note severity)
  - What's Working Well
  - Discussion Notes

#### Scenario: Verdict is a closed merge-gate vocabulary
- **GIVEN** synthesis is complete and an outcome must be recorded
- **WHEN** the verdict is chosen
- **THEN** it SHALL be exactly one of `APPROVE`, `REQUEST CHANGES`, or `NEEDS DISCUSSION`
- **AND** the presence of non-blocking residual work (follow-ups, suggestions) SHALL NOT change the verdict away from `APPROVE`
- **AND** that residual work SHALL be represented as findings with category `should_fix`, `suggestion`, or `style`

#### Scenario: Verdict and blocker findings are chosen consistently
- **GIVEN** synthesis has produced the final finding set
- **WHEN** the verdict is chosen
- **THEN** `REQUEST CHANGES` SHALL be emitted only if the deduplicated blocker count is ≥ 1
- **AND** `APPROVE` SHALL be emitted only if the deduplicated blocker count is 0
- **AND** `NEEDS DISCUSSION` MAY be emitted regardless of the blocker count

### Requirement: Existing Map Reference

The review workflow SHALL support natural language references to existing map artifacts, allowing the Tech Lead to use a previously-generated map as additional context when explicitly referenced by the user.

#### Scenario: Natural language map reference
- **GIVEN** user requests a review and references an existing map
- **WHEN** message contains phrases like "I've already generated a map", "use the map I created", "check the map in this session", or similar
- **THEN** the Tech Lead SHALL:
  - Check for existing map artifacts in the session's `map/` directory
  - If found: Read the latest run's `map.md` as supplementary context
  - If not found: Inform user no map exists and proceed with standard review

#### Scenario: Map as supplementary context
- **GIVEN** user has referenced an existing map
- **WHEN** Tech Lead reads the map artifacts
- **THEN** the Tech Lead MAY use the map to:
  - Gain additional understanding of changeset structure
  - Reference section groupings when summarizing changes
  - Note the map's hypotheses as background context
- **AND** the Tech Lead SHALL still perform standard investigation independently

#### Scenario: No automatic map usage
- **GIVEN** a map exists in the session
- **WHEN** user does NOT explicitly reference the map during review
- **THEN** the system SHALL NOT automatically use map artifacts
- **AND** the review SHALL proceed with standard context gathering

#### Scenario: Map and review as orthogonal tools
- **GIVEN** user runs `/ocr:review` without referencing a map
- **WHEN** the review workflow executes
- **THEN** the standard review workflow SHALL proceed unchanged:
  - Tech Lead performs initial analysis with standard context gathering
  - Reviewer sub-agents explore upstream/downstream as needed
  - No dependency on map artifacts

### Requirement: Phase 4 Reads the Resolved Team via OCR

The Tech Lead SHALL read the resolved team composition by calling `ocr team resolve --json` at the start of Phase 4, rather than parsing `default_team` from `.ocr/config.yaml` directly.

#### Scenario: Tech Lead reads team via OCR

- **GIVEN** a review enters Phase 4
- **WHEN** the Tech Lead determines which reviewers to spawn
- **THEN** the Tech Lead SHALL invoke `ocr team resolve --json`
- **AND** the returned array SHALL be the source of truth for personas, instance counts, instance names, and per-instance model assignments

#### Scenario: Session-time override is respected

- **GIVEN** the user invokes a review with a session-level team override (via dashboard panel or `--team` CLI flag)
- **WHEN** the Tech Lead calls `ocr team resolve --json --session-override <override>`
- **THEN** the resolved composition SHALL reflect the override
- **AND** the override SHALL NOT be persisted to `.ocr/config.yaml`

---

### Requirement: Per-Instance Model Selection Honored on Capable Hosts

When the host AI CLI supports per-task model override (e.g. Claude Code subagent model frontmatter), Phase 4 SHALL pass each reviewer instance's `resolved_model` to the host's per-task primitive.

#### Scenario: Capable host honors per-instance models

- **GIVEN** a host CLI whose adapter reports `supportsPerTaskModel = true`
- **AND** a resolved team with two `principal` instances on different models
- **WHEN** Phase 4 spawns the reviewers
- **THEN** each instance SHALL be spawned with its assigned model
- **AND** each `agent_sessions` row SHALL record the actual `resolved_model` used

#### Scenario: Incapable host runs uniform parent model with warning

- **GIVEN** a host CLI whose adapter reports `supportsPerTaskModel = false`
- **AND** a resolved team that specifies different models per instance
- **WHEN** Phase 4 spawns the reviewers
- **THEN** all instances SHALL run on the parent process's model
- **AND** each `agent_sessions` row SHALL set `notes` to a structured warning indicating per-task model override is not supported on this host
- **AND** the warning SHALL be surfaced to the user in the final review output

---

### Requirement: Phase 4 Journals Each Instance via OCR

For every reviewer instance spawned in Phase 4, the Tech Lead SHALL record its lifecycle through the `ocr session` subcommand family.

#### Scenario: Instance start is journaled

- **GIVEN** a reviewer instance is about to be spawned
- **WHEN** the Tech Lead initiates the spawn
- **THEN** it SHALL first invoke `ocr session start-instance` with the workflow id, persona, instance index, name, vendor, and resolved model
- **AND** SHALL receive an `agent_sessions` id in return

#### Scenario: Vendor session id is bound when emitted

- **GIVEN** a spawned reviewer sub-agent emits its underlying CLI session id
- **WHEN** the Tech Lead observes the id
- **THEN** it SHALL invoke `ocr session bind-vendor-id <agent-id> <vendor-id>` exactly once

#### Scenario: Heartbeat is bumped between phases

- **GIVEN** a long-running reviewer instance is mid-review
- **WHEN** the Tech Lead progresses to a new sub-step or returns from a long tool call
- **THEN** it SHALL invoke `ocr session beat <agent-id>` to refresh `last_heartbeat_at`

#### Scenario: Instance end is journaled

- **GIVEN** a reviewer instance has completed (success, crash, or cancellation)
- **WHEN** the Tech Lead observes completion
- **THEN** it SHALL invoke `ocr session end-instance <agent-id>` with an appropriate exit code and optional note

---

### Requirement: OCR Does Not Own Phase 4 Process Spawning

The system SHALL NOT introduce a Phase 4 process orchestrator that spawns reviewer sub-agents from within OCR's own command-runner; sub-agent spawning remains the responsibility of the host AI CLI.

#### Scenario: command-runner does not fork per-reviewer adapters

- **GIVEN** a review enters Phase 4
- **WHEN** the dashboard's `command-runner.ts` orchestrates the review
- **THEN** it SHALL NOT fork one adapter process per reviewer instance
- **AND** the host AI CLI SHALL spawn sub-agents using its own per-task primitive

### Requirement: Reviewers Run on Hosts Without a Sub-Agent Primitive

Phase 4 SHALL be expressed host-neutrally so that a review runs on any supported AI CLI. When the host CLI can spawn sub-agents (e.g. Claude Code's Task tool, OpenCode's sub-agent primitive), reviewers MAY be spawned in parallel. When the host CLI has no sub-agent primitive (e.g. Gemini CLI, Codex), the orchestrator SHALL run each reviewer sequentially as a fresh analytical pass within its own conversation. Both strategies SHALL journal each instance's **liveness** identically via the `ocr session` command family (`start-instance` / `beat` / `end-instance`). Binding a vendor session id (`bind-vendor-id`) is reserved for spawned sub-agents that each own a distinct host session; sequential reviewers share the one parent conversation and SHALL NOT bind a per-reviewer vendor session id. The skill instructions SHALL NOT assume a Claude-style Task tool exists.

#### Scenario: Host with a sub-agent primitive

- **GIVEN** a host CLI that can spawn sub-agents
- **WHEN** Phase 4 runs
- **THEN** the orchestrator MAY spawn one sub-agent per resolved reviewer instance in parallel

#### Scenario: Host without a sub-agent primitive

- **GIVEN** a host CLI with no Task/sub-agent primitive (e.g. Gemini CLI, Codex)
- **WHEN** Phase 4 runs
- **THEN** the orchestrator SHALL run each resolved reviewer instance sequentially as a fresh pass in the same conversation
- **AND** each instance SHALL be journaled for liveness via `ocr session start-instance` / `beat` / `end-instance`
- **AND** each instance SHALL be started with `--note "sequential strategy"` and SHALL NOT be bound to a vendor session id (no `bind-vendor-id`), because the reviewers share the one parent conversation and have no per-reviewer host session

#### Scenario: Sequential reviewers render without resume affordances

- **GIVEN** sequential reviewer rows journaled without a bound vendor session id
- **WHEN** the dashboard renders the round's reviewers
- **THEN** it SHALL show their liveness state (Running / Stalled / Orphaned / done)
- **AND** it SHALL NOT offer "Continue here" / "Pick up in terminal" resume for them, since there is no per-reviewer host session to resume — this is expected, not an error

#### Scenario: Sequential reviewers do not fork OCR processes

- **WHEN** reviewers run sequentially on a host without a sub-agent primitive
- **THEN** OCR SHALL NOT fork one adapter process per reviewer (consistent with "OCR Does Not Own Phase 4 Process Spawning")
- **AND** the reviewers run within the host AI CLI's own process

### Requirement: Atomic Completion Contract

The orchestrating Tech Lead SHALL finalize rounds and close sessions exclusively through the atomic state porcelain (`ocr state complete-round` / `complete-map` / `finish`), so that completion is always invariant-checked and a workflow can never be reported complete before its work is done.

To reduce the rate of mid-pipeline strands (a vendor-neutral failure: any turn-ending event between phases leaves the run incomplete), the orchestrator SHOULD drive the pipeline to `complete-round` within the same turn that produced the reviews and SHOULD NOT voluntarily end the turn between phases. This is non-vendor CONTROL guidance; it does not mandate or forbid any host primitive (e.g. background spawning), and recovery via forward-resume remains the backstop for the turn-ending events that cannot be prevented.

**Canonical CONTROL prompt.** The fixed instruction an out-of-turn resumer injects is defined once here (the home of orchestrator behavior) and referenced by name elsewhere (the cli `Resume Flag on Existing Review Command` and the dashboard auto-resume): *"read `ocr state status --json` and act on `next_action`, continuing forward from `current_phase` without redoing completed phases."* It is CONTROL, never injected review context, and is identical across hosts; all per-vendor delivery differences are confined to the adapter.

On resume, the orchestrator SHALL drive the pipeline **forward** from `current_phase` and SHALL behave identically across hosts. It reads `ocr state status --json`, and when `next_action` is `forward_resume` it re-enters `current_phase` and continues through the remaining phases — the workflow's own phase execution reuses already-produced artifacts (e.g. Phase 4 re-spawns only the reviewers whose outputs are absent) rather than re-producing them. This continuation SHALL behave identically on sub-agent-fanout hosts (where Phase 4 fanned out isolated reviewers) and on sequential-shared-context hosts (where reviewers, discourse, and synthesis are co-resident in one long turn): in both cases resume is in-turn forward progress keyed on `next_action`, never a regression of `current_phase` and never a dependency on any background process outliving the turn.

#### Scenario: Round finalized via the atomic command

- **GIVEN** the orchestrator has produced `final.md` and round metadata for the current round
- **WHEN** it finalizes the round
- **THEN** it SHALL pipe the metadata to `ocr state complete-round --stdin` (which atomically records the artifact, the `round_completed` event, the round advance, and the transition to `complete`)
- **AND** it SHALL NOT rely on a sequence of separate `transition` + `round-complete` + `close` calls that can partially apply

#### Scenario: Session closed only when complete

- **WHEN** the orchestrator ends a workflow
- **THEN** it SHALL call `ocr state finish`, which refuses to close a session whose current round is not complete
- **AND** if the workflow is being abandoned, it SHALL call `ocr state finish --abort`, recording a non-success terminal state

#### Scenario: Resume diagnoses what is missing

- **GIVEN** the orchestrator resumes a session that may have ended prematurely
- **WHEN** it inspects state
- **THEN** it SHALL call `ocr state status --json` to obtain the `completeness_state` and the unmet obligations
- **AND** it SHALL act on the reported `next_action` rather than inferring state from filesystem inspection

#### Scenario: Forward-resume continues from current_phase

- **GIVEN** the orchestrator resumes a session whose `status --json` reports `next_action = forward_resume` with `current_phase = reviews`
- **WHEN** it continues the workflow
- **THEN** it SHALL re-enter `reviews` and proceed through the remaining phases, the workflow re-spawning only the reviewers whose outputs are absent
- **AND** it SHALL NOT regress `current_phase`

#### Scenario: Resume continuation is host-identical

- **GIVEN** two resumes of equivalent stranded runs, one on a sub-agent-fanout host and one on a sequential-shared-context host
- **WHEN** each orchestrator acts on `next_action = forward_resume`
- **THEN** both SHALL make the same forward progress through the remaining phases driven by the same `ocr state` surface (the `next_action` progression is identical)
- **AND** neither SHALL depend on a background process or cross-process wait that outlives the agent turn

### Requirement: Output Language Policy

Every model task the Tech Lead runs (reviewers, ephemeral reviewers, discourse, synthesis, map) SHALL receive the configured output language and SHALL write its prose in that language while keeping the structural tokens the CLI and dashboard parse in English.

#### Scenario: Language propagated to sub-agents

- **GIVEN** `language: es` in `.ocr/config.yaml`
- **WHEN** Phase 1 builds `discovered-standards.md` and Phase 4 spawns reviewers
- **THEN** `discovered-standards.md` records `## Output Language: es`
- **AND** each reviewer task carries the language policy with `es`

#### Scenario: Structural tokens stay English

- **GIVEN** a reviewer, discourse or synthesis task with a non-English language
- **WHEN** the model writes its output
- **THEN** section headings (`## Summary`, `## Findings`, `### Finding N:`, `## Verdict`, `## Blockers`, `## Should Fix`, `## Suggestions`, …), field labels (`Severity`, `Location`, `Issue`, `Why It Matters`, `Suggestion`), verdict values, category and severity vocabularies, discourse verbs, code, file paths, identifiers, commands and quoted error messages are written exactly as the templates define them in English
- **AND** the existing reviewer and final parsers extract the same findings and counts as for an English review

#### Scenario: English is byte-identical to today

- **GIVEN** the language resolves to `en`
- **WHEN** any task prompt is assembled
- **THEN** no language policy text is added

### Requirement: PR Target in a Dedicated Worktree

The review and map workflows SHALL accept a pull-request target (`pr:<number>` or a GitHub PR URL) and SHALL review it from a dedicated git worktree without modifying the user's working tree.

#### Scenario: Resolve and fetch the PR

- **GIVEN** the user runs `/ocr:review pr:123`
- **WHEN** Phase 2 resolves the target
- **THEN** the Tech Lead resolves the number with `gh pr view 123 --repo <origin owner/repo> --json url` and reads the PR with `gh pr view <url> --json number,url,headRefName,headRefOid,baseRefName,author`
- **AND** fetches `pull/123/head` into `refs/ocr/pr/123` and the base ref from `origin`
- **AND** `git rev-parse refs/ocr/pr/123` equals `headRefOid`, and that sha is the recorded `head_sha`
- **AND** creates or updates the worktree at `<worktrees.dir>/pr-123` detached at that ref

#### Scenario: Reviewers use the worktree as code root

- **GIVEN** a PR-targeted session
- **WHEN** reviewer, discourse, synthesis or map sub-agents are spawned
- **THEN** each task states the worktree path as the code root and reviewers read files from it
- **AND** the diff is `git diff origin/<base>...refs/ocr/pr/<n>` run in the main checkout

#### Scenario: Session identity for PR targets

- **GIVEN** a PR target
- **WHEN** the session is created
- **THEN** its id is `{date}-pr-<number>` and `sessions.branch` holds the PR head branch name

#### Scenario: Only origin's PRs are supported

- **GIVEN** a PR URL whose `<owner>/<repo>` differs from the repository behind `origin`
- **WHEN** the target is resolved
- **THEN** the workflow stops with an error saying only PRs of `<origin owner/repo>` are supported, and fetches nothing

#### Scenario: PR moved between view and fetch

- **GIVEN** `git rev-parse refs/ocr/pr/<n>` after the fetch differs from the `headRefOid` that `gh pr view` returned
- **WHEN** the target is resolved
- **THEN** the workflow stops naming both SHAs and asks the user to re-run

#### Scenario: Existing worktree has local changes

- **GIVEN** `<worktrees.dir>/pr-123` is a registered worktree and `git status --porcelain` there is not empty
- **WHEN** the target is resolved
- **THEN** the workflow stops and suggests `ocr worktree remove 123 --force`, and does not check out the new head

#### Scenario: Path exists but is not a worktree

- **GIVEN** `<worktrees.dir>/pr-123` exists and is not a registered worktree
- **WHEN** the target is resolved
- **THEN** the workflow stops with an error naming the path, and nothing is deleted

#### Scenario: PR head is the current checkout

- **GIVEN** the current checkout is on the PR's head branch, `HEAD` equals the PR's `headRefOid` and `git status --porcelain` is empty
- **WHEN** the PR target is resolved
- **THEN** no worktree is created, the review runs in place with a one-line notice
- **AND** the session still uses id `{date}-pr-<number>` and records the PR refs

#### Scenario: Dirty checkout is never reviewed in place

- **GIVEN** the checkout matches the PR head but `git status --porcelain` is not empty
- **WHEN** the PR target is resolved
- **THEN** the review uses the worktree instead of the checkout
#### Scenario: Untrusted code notice

- **WHEN** a PR target is resolved
- **THEN** the Tech Lead tells the user that running the PR's code (tests, scripts) executes untrusted code, exactly as checking the branch out would

### Requirement: Reviewed Commit Recorded

Every session and every round SHALL record the exact commit reviewed.

#### Scenario: Session records refs

- **WHEN** `ocr state begin` is called for a PR target
- **THEN** it stores `base_ref`, `head_ref`, `head_sha`, `pr_number` and `pr_url` on the session
- **AND** `head_ref` is the local ref that was reviewed (`refs/ocr/pr/<n>`) and `branch` is the PR head branch name

#### Scenario: Round records the head

- **WHEN** Phase 7 finalizes a round
- **THEN** the `complete-round` JSON carries `head_sha` and it is persisted in `round-meta.json`

#### Scenario: New round after a push

- **GIVEN** a closed PR session whose PR head moved
- **WHEN** `/ocr:review <pr_url>` runs again the same day
- **THEN** the worktree is updated to the new head, a new round starts, and the session's `head_sha` is updated

### Requirement: Requirement Sources

The system SHALL fetch requirements from a ClickUp task, a GitHub issue or PR, a local file or literal text through deterministic adapters run by the CLI, never by the model, and SHALL keep the raw content in the session.

#### Scenario: ClickUp card by URL

- **GIVEN** `--requirements https://app.clickup.com/t/abc123` and `CLICKUP_API_TOKEN` in the environment
- **WHEN** Phase 1 runs
- **THEN** `ocr requirements fetch` writes `requirements/source.md` (title, description, checklists, custom fields) and `requirements/source.json` (type, id, url, fetched_at, updated_at, author)

#### Scenario: Comments on demand

- **WHEN** `--with-comments` is given
- **THEN** the last 50 comments (author, date, text) are appended to `source.md`; otherwise none are fetched

#### Scenario: Missing credential

- **GIVEN** a ClickUp source and no `CLICKUP_API_TOKEN`
- **WHEN** the fetch runs
- **THEN** it fails naming the variable and writes nothing; the model is never asked to fetch the card

#### Scenario: GitHub and local sources

- **WHEN** the source is a GitHub issue/PR URL, a file path or plain text
- **THEN** the matching adapter produces the same two files (`gh` for GitHub)

#### Scenario: Suggestion from the PR body

- **GIVEN** a `pr:<n>` target whose body links a ClickUp task or a GitHub issue
- **WHEN** Phase 1 runs without `--requirements`
- **THEN** the Tech Lead prints the detected link as a suggestion and proceeds without requirements unless the user provides them

### Requirement: Requirements Normalization

The Tech Lead SHALL derive `requirements.md` from the raw sources with fixed sections and numbered acceptance criteria, labelling each criterion as quoted or derived.

#### Scenario: Normalized file

- **GIVEN** one or more `requirements/source*.md`
- **WHEN** Phase 1 completes
- **THEN** `requirements.md` contains `## Source`, `## Acceptance Criteria` with `### AC-n:` entries marked `(quoted)` or `(derived)`, `## Out of Scope` and `## Open Questions`, in the configured language with English headings

#### Scenario: Nothing dropped

- **WHEN** the source states a requirement
- **THEN** it appears as a quoted criterion; derived criteria are only added when the source implies them and are labelled

#### Scenario: Reviewers reference criteria

- **WHEN** reviewers and the synthesis assess requirements
- **THEN** each assessment row references `AC-n`
